One time we sat on the same couch, together with Andrew Ni and Jacqui Giese. The four of us went to grab a meal as the couch group at Menkoi Ya Ramen, where we friended each other on snapchat. A day later, Jon sent Ke a snapchat photo at 8 am of the saphire blue sky, in bold text it said, 'time to go to sleep'. Ke responded, 'oh no.' That is how we started chatting.",
