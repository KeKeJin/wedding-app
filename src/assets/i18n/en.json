One time Jon and Ke sat on the same couch at bible study, together with Andrew Ni and Jacqui Giese. The four of them went to grab a meal at Menkoi Ya Ramen, and friended each other on Snapchat. A day later, Jon sent Ke a snapchat photo of the 8am sun, in bold text it said, 'time to go to sleep'. Jon appearantly had just finished a hackthon the night before, and he probably did not expect anyone to respond to his Snapchat photo, because that is how Snapchat works. You share your life with your friends, and they don't respond back. But not knowing the Snapchat culture, and also feeling sorry for Jon, Ke texted Jon back on Snapchat, 'oh no.' That is how Jon and Ke started chatting.",
